# Crop-Disease-Detection
Note: This project is currently not uploaded because it is located locally on a separate desktop that I do not have on campus, and will be uploaded sometime in the next day or two, when I plan on visitng home for a few days.

# Project Description and Goal
In this project, I develop a Deep CNN image classifer for crop disease detection using Tensorflow and Keras. The goal was to train the model on a series of images so that I would later be able to input an image into the model and it would be able to tell me about the state of the crop and whether it was diseased or dying. In order to train my model, I implemented preprocessing steps that included data scaling and splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. I then used Matplotlib to visualize the results of my model.
